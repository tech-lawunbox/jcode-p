# Harness Events

`harness-events` is the structured execution-event foundation for the jcode-harness cockpit. The first slice is intentionally local and in-process: it defines a typed event schema and a broadcast EventBus that future NDJSON, replay, SSE, broker, gRPC, and WebSocket adapters can consume.

For consumer-facing examples, CI recipes, transport selection guidance, troubleshooting, and schema stability policy, see [`HARNESS_EVENTS_PROTOCOL.md`](HARNESS_EVENTS_PROTOCOL.md).

## Current scope

Implemented in `src/harness_events.rs`:

- `HARNESS_EVENT_SCHEMA_VERSION = 1`.
- `HarnessEventLevel` with `trace`, `debug`, `info`, `warn`, and `error`.
- `HarnessEventKind` with run, skill, memory, tool, file, test, gate, approval, and control-command events.
- `HarnessEventPayloadClass` with `safe_metadata`, `sensitive_metadata`, `secret`, `user_content`, and `artifact_reference`.
- `HarnessEvent` as the serialized object.
- `HarnessEventDraft` for producer-side construction.
- `HarnessEventBus` for in-process pub/sub fan-out.
- Default payload redaction before events leave the bus.
- Local NDJSON writer/append helpers for already-redacted `HarnessEvent` objects.
- `HarnessControlCommand` plus `harness_control_command_event_draft` for auditable dashboard/WebSocket control commands.
- `HarnessEventSink` / `HarnessEventSource` traits plus NDJSON implementations for future broker adapters.
- Deterministic broker route mapping for NATS subjects, Redis stream keys, and durable consumer names without storing broker IDs in the event schema.

Consumers should subscribe to the in-process bus first, then attach sinks such as NDJSON, SSE, or future WebSocket/broker adapters.

## Event object

Example:

```json
{
  "schema_version": 1,
  "event_id": "hevt_1778209200000_123",
  "run_id": "run_demo",
  "session_id": "session_demo",
  "parent_event_id": "hevt_parent",
  "timestamp": "2026-05-08T03:00:00Z",
  "sequence": 7,
  "level": "info",
  "kind": "tool_finished",
  "payload_class": "safe_metadata",
  "payload": {
    "tool": "cargo test",
    "status": "passed"
  }
}
```

Common fields:

- `schema_version`: event schema version. Increment only for incompatible changes.
- `event_id`: unique event identifier.
- `run_id`: stable run/correlation identifier.
- `session_id`: optional session that owns or observed the event.
- `parent_event_id`: optional parent for nested operations.
- `timestamp`: UTC timestamp.
- `sequence`: monotonic per-`run_id` sequence assigned by `HarnessEventBus`.
- `level`: severity/verbosity level.
- `kind`: typed event kind.
- `payload_class`: producer-declared sensitivity class. `secret` and `user_content` payloads are redacted wholesale by default.
- `payload`: structured metadata. Keep it redacted and reference artifacts instead of embedding large or sensitive content.

## Privacy and redaction

The core bus redacts payloads before publishing. This is intentionally enforced at the producer-to-bus boundary so future NDJSON, replay, SSE, broker, gRPC, or WebSocket sinks receive already-redacted events by default.

Current rules:

- `secret` and `user_content` payload classes are replaced with a small redaction marker.
- Sensitive object keys are redacted recursively, including token/API-key/password/auth/cookie/prompt/input/stdout/stderr/tool-output style names.
- Secret-looking string values such as `Bearer ...`, `ghp_...`, `github_pat_...`, `sk-...`, and PEM private-key material are redacted even when the key is not known.
- Long strings are truncated to a bounded length and suffixed with `...[truncated]`.
- Safe metadata remains available when it does not match a redaction rule.

Examples:

```json
{
  "payload_class": "safe_metadata",
  "payload": {
    "tool": "deploy",
    "api_key": "[redacted]",
    "nested": { "Authorization": "[redacted]", "safe": "metadata" }
  }
}
```

```json
{
  "payload_class": "user_content",
  "payload": {
    "redacted": true,
    "payload_class": "user_content"
  }
}
```

## Retention and sampling status

Durable NDJSON logs now have explicit local retention controls. `jcode events prune` is safe by default: it reports the logs that would be removed and only deletes files when `--apply` is present.

Examples:

```bash
jcode events prune --keep-logs 50
jcode events prune --keep-logs 50 --json
jcode events prune --keep-logs 50 --max-total-bytes 104857600 --apply
```

Retention policy semantics:

- logs are ordered newest-first by filesystem modification time;
- `--keep-logs N` keeps at most the newest `N` local `.ndjson` logs;
- `--max-total-bytes B` keeps newest logs until adding the next log would exceed `B` bytes;
- `--apply` is required for deletion, otherwise the command is a dry-run report.

Runtime producers also expose conservative sampling knobs for high-volume streams:

```bash
JCODE_HARNESS_EVENTS_MIN_LEVEL=warn jcode run --ndjson "..."
JCODE_HARNESS_EVENTS_TOOL_SAMPLE_EVERY=10 jcode run --ndjson "..."
```

Sampling policy semantics:

- `JCODE_HARNESS_EVENTS_MIN_LEVEL` accepts `trace`, `debug`, `info`, `warn`, or `error` and drops events below that severity before writing the durable log.
- `JCODE_HARNESS_EVENTS_TOOL_SAMPLE_EVERY=N` keeps the first tool event of each sampled kind and then one of every `N` info-level tool events. `1` or an unset value records all tool events.
- `warn` and `error` events are always retained after the minimum-level check so failures are not hidden by tool-event sampling.

Producer guidance until high-volume runtime coverage is broader:

- do not store raw event payloads outside the bus;
- prefer artifact references over inline content;
- classify prompts, file contents, raw tool stdout/stderr, and secrets as `user_content` or `secret`;
- keep high-volume events at `trace`/`debug` for future sampling knobs.

## NDJSON local sink

The first NDJSON slice is a low-level sink API for redacted `HarnessEvent` objects:

```rust
use jcode::harness_events::{
    HarnessEventBus,
    HarnessEventDraft,
    append_harness_event_ndjson,
    harness_event_log_path,
};

let bus = HarnessEventBus::global();
let event = bus.publish(HarnessEventDraft::run_started("run_123"));
let path = harness_event_log_path("run_123");
append_harness_event_ndjson(&path, &event)?;
```

Sink guarantees:

- one compact JSON object per line;
- every line is independently parseable as `HarnessEvent`;
- parent directories are created on append;
- file names are derived from sanitized `run_id` values;
- payloads have already passed through the core redaction path.

The default log directory is under `JCODE_RUNTIME_DIR` when set, otherwise the platform runtime directory, in a `harness-events/` subdirectory. Runtime producer coverage is currently incremental: `jcode run --ndjson` writes typed run/tool summary events and exposes `harness_run_id` plus `harness_event_log` in its `start`, `done`, and `error` records.

## Pluggable sinks, sources, and broker routes

The first #22 slice keeps local-first builds dependency-free while defining the extension seam for NATS JetStream, Redis Streams, or other durable adapters.

Core traits:

- `HarnessEventSink::publish_event(&HarnessEvent)` returns a `HarnessEventSinkAck` with sink name, durability, event id, run id, and optional message id.
- `HarnessEventSource::read_events_after(run_id, last_event_id)` returns replayable events with `Last-Event-ID` semantics.
- `HarnessEventNdjsonSink` and `HarnessEventNdjsonSource` implement those traits over the existing local NDJSON logs.

Broker routing stays outside the event envelope. `harness_event_broker_route(&event)` derives deterministic adapter metadata:

```text
nats_subject:     jcode.harness_events.v1.run.<hex_run_id>[.session.<hex_session_id>][.task.<hex_task_id>]
redis_stream_key: jcode:harness-events:v1:run:<hex_run_id>:events[:session:<hex_session_id>][:task:<hex_task_id>]
durable_consumer: jcode-harness-<hex_run_id>
```

The route encodes run/session/task components as ASCII-safe hex tokens so broker separators and wildcards cannot collide with user-provided ids. Future broker adapters should use this mapping for publish/consume configuration, while still writing local NDJSON evidence first so broker outages do not erase audit trails.

Broker messages use a versioned envelope from `serialize_harness_event_broker_payload`. The current delivery semantics are explicitly `at_least_once`: consumers must deduplicate by the envelope `dedupe_key` (`schema_version` + `event_id`). `HarnessEventDelivery` and `HarnessEventDeliveryAck` carry adapter-neutral message id, redelivery, attempt, and ack outcome metadata so future JetStream and Redis adapters do not need to fork the event schema.

`HarnessEventMemoryBroker` exercises the same envelope and ack contract without pulling broker dependencies into the core build. It is useful for adapter tests and local contract validation, but it is not durable evidence; real runs should still preserve NDJSON first.

`HarnessEventFanoutSink` composes that policy directly: it writes local NDJSON/audit evidence first, then attempts broker publish. Normal mode captures broker failure in `HarnessEventFanoutReport` without losing the local proof; strict mode can return an error after the local write has succeeded.

`HarnessEventRedisStreamSink` is the first real optional adapter behind `--features harness-events-redis`. It uses Redis Streams `XADD`, maps Redis stream ids to `HarnessEventSinkAck.message_id`, and keeps the default build free of Redis dependencies. `HarnessEventRedisStreamSource` adds the matching opt-in read side with `XRANGE` polling over configured stream keys plus parser helpers that turn Redis entries back into `HarnessEventDelivery`. `harness_event_redis_stream_ack_command` defines when an adapter should issue `XACK`: `acked` and `dropped` outcomes acknowledge the broker message, while `nacked` stays pending for retry/redelivery evidence. Live Redis round-trip coverage is opt-in with `JCODE_HARNESS_EVENTS_REDIS_URL`.

## SSE protocol core

The first SSE slice is transport-neutral framing for future local dashboard endpoints. A `HarnessEvent` maps to a Server-Sent Events message as:

- `Content-Type: text/event-stream`
- `id`: `event_id`, used by browser `Last-Event-ID` resume.
- `event`: the snake_case `HarnessEventKind`, such as `tool_finished`.
- `retry`: optional reconnect delay, default helper value `2000` ms.
- `data`: compact JSON serialization of the already-redacted `HarnessEvent`.

Example frame:

```text
id: hevt_demo
event: tool_finished
retry: 2000
data: {"schema_version":1,"event_id":"hevt_demo","run_id":"run_demo","timestamp":"2026-05-08T04:22:00Z","sequence":3,"level":"info","kind":"tool_finished","payload_class":"safe_metadata","payload":{"tool":"cargo test","status":"ok"}}

```

Browser clients can later consume the local endpoint with standard EventSource APIs:

```js
const events = new EventSource("http://127.0.0.1:PORT/events/runs/run_demo/stream");
events.addEventListener("tool_finished", (event) => {
  const harnessEvent = JSON.parse(event.data);
  console.log(harnessEvent.sequence, harnessEvent.payload.status);
});
events.onerror = () => console.warn("event stream reconnecting");
```

The gateway endpoint is exposed at `GET /events/runs/{urlencoded_run_id}/stream` for paired clients. It reuses `write_harness_event_sse`, `render_harness_event_sse`, and `harness_events_after_last_event_id` so `Last-Event-ID` replays retained local events before subscribing to live fan-out. Use `?replay=only` for scripts/tests that want the retained tail and a closed connection.

## WebSocket control protocol core

The first #24 slice defines the bidirectional command envelope that a WebSocket UI can send without scraping terminal text. Commands are parsed and validated by `HarnessControlCommand`, then converted into redacted/auditable `HarnessEventDraft` values with `harness_control_command_event_draft`.

The gateway bridge now intercepts supported control commands on `/ws` before forwarding normal newline-delimited protocol messages to the Unix-socket bridge. Non-control messages continue through the existing bridge unchanged. Handled control commands receive a JSON acknowledgement frame containing the emitted audit event.

Example approval resolution command:

```json
{
  "command": "resolve_human_approval",
  "run_id": "run_demo",
  "approval_id": "approval_deploy",
  "decision": "approved",
  "actor": "dashboard",
  "reason": "user clicked approve",
  "client_command_id": "cmd_1"
}
```

Auditing behavior:

- `subscribe_events` is read-only and does not require write authorization.
- `resolve_human_approval`, `pause_run`, `resume_run`, `cancel_run`, and `ui_command` require write authorization from the gateway/client layer.
- authorized approval resolutions emit `human_approval_resolved` with `approval_id`, `decision`, `actor`, `reason_present`, and `client_command_id` metadata;
- unauthorized write commands emit `control_command_rejected` at `warn` level;
- free-form reasons are not copied into the audit payload, only `reason_present`, to avoid leaking user text;
- command `args` still pass through the normal redaction rules before publication.
- unsupported command names and ordinary protocol messages are not intercepted and continue through the existing bridge unchanged.

## gRPC control-plane contract

#23 starts with a transport contract rather than a mandatory runtime dependency. The proto snapshot lives at `proto/jcode/harness_events/v1/control.proto` with package `jcode.harness_events.v1` and service `HarnessAgentControl`.

The first Rust bridge keeps the core event schema canonical:

- `HarnessGrpcEventFrame` embeds already-redacted `HarnessEvent` JSON and validates protocol/schema/run/event/sequence metadata on decode.
- `HarnessGrpcControlCommandFrame` embeds the existing `HarnessControlCommand` JSON and validates command name, run id, and write authorization metadata.
- `HarnessGrpcAgentIdentity` validates agent registration identity, capabilities, protocol version, and event schema version.
- `HarnessGrpcLocalControlPlane` is the dependency-free local prototype for #23. It lets tests exercise orchestrator/worker registration, task assignment, event upload, command delivery, cancellation, bounded queue backpressure, and disconnect/reconnect behavior using the same gRPC frame structs before a tonic server is introduced.
- `jcode-harness demo grpc-control --json` prints a deterministic local transcript, and `jcode-harness demo run grpc-control-plane-local --json` validates that transcript through the existing child-process demo runner.

Future tonic servers should bind to loopback by default, require explicit opt-in for remote exposure, and preserve the existing read/write authorization split before accepting distributed commands.

### CLI helpers

`jcode events` exposes the local sink without mixing human text into NDJSON streams:

```bash
jcode events path --run run_123
jcode events path --run run_123 --json
jcode events list --json
jcode events show --run run_123 --json
jcode events tail --run run_123 --lines 50
jcode events tail --run run_123 --lines 50 --ndjson
jcode events export --run run_123 --output run.ndjson --json
jcode events export --run run_123 > run.ndjson
jcode events sse --run run_123 --last-event-id hevt_seen > run.sse
jcode events prune --keep-logs 50 --json
jcode events replay --run run_123 > replay.md
jcode events replay --run run_123 --json > replay.json
jcode events bench --events 10000 --json > harness-events-bench.json
```

- `path` prints the sanitized default log path for a run id.
- `list` indexes local `.ndjson` logs and marks corrupt files instead of hiding them.
- `show` prints summary metadata for one run.
- `tail --ndjson` writes only raw event NDJSON to stdout.
- `export` validates each source line as `HarnessEvent` before rewriting normalized NDJSON.
- `export --json` requires `--output` so stdout remains machine-safe.
- `sse` validates the local log and writes EventSource-compatible SSE frames to stdout or `--output`; `--last-event-id` emits only events after a retained event id.
- `prune` reports retention candidates by newest-first log order; pass `--apply` to actually delete local event logs.
- `replay` reconstructs a local audit timeline as Markdown by default, or JSON with `--json`. Replay output includes phase grouping, elapsed milliseconds, parent event references, child counts, duration hints, and explicit failure points.

Replay and indexing use a tolerant read report for auditability: valid event lines are retained, invalid or truncated lines are surfaced as line-numbered diagnostics, and JSON replay includes a `diagnostics` array alongside `summary`, `timeline`, and `events`. Strict NDJSON consumers such as `tail --ndjson` and `export` still fail on malformed input so automation does not silently consume damaged streams.

### Performance baseline

`jcode events bench` runs a dependency-free synthetic baseline for #25. It measures event publish with no subscribers, NDJSON serialization to memory, NDJSON write/read through a temporary file, and replay timeline construction. The report is intentionally a baseline, not a hard CI threshold yet, because numbers depend on machine, build profile, filesystem, and event payload size.

Recommended use while tuning defaults:

```bash
cargo run -q -p jcode --bin jcode -- events bench --events 10000 --json \
  > harness-events-bench.json
```

Compare reports on the same machine/profile before changing buffer capacities, flush behavior, retention, or sampling. The initial budget guidance is: no-subscriber publish must stay non-blocking, NDJSON writes flush safely without fsync by default, replay parsing must report diagnostics rather than panic, and long-running modes must bound in-memory buffers.

Slow subscribers are intentionally backpressured by Tokio broadcast semantics instead of blocking publishers: each in-process subscriber reads from a bounded ring, lagging receivers observe `Lagged` and may miss old in-memory events. Durable consumers that cannot lose events should attach to the NDJSON sink or a future broker-backed transport rather than relying on the in-memory fan-out ring alone.

## Minimal producer usage

```rust
use jcode::harness_events::{HarnessEventBus, HarnessEventDraft};

let bus = HarnessEventBus::global();
let started = bus.publish(HarnessEventDraft::run_started("run_123"));
let completed = bus.publish(HarnessEventDraft::run_completed("run_123"));
assert_eq!(started.sequence, 1);
assert_eq!(completed.sequence, 2);
```

## Design constraints

- Local-first: no broker or network service is required.
- Non-blocking fan-out: slow or absent subscribers must not fail event production.
- Versioned schema: later sinks should rely on `schema_version` and typed `kind`.
- Privacy-first payloads: raw prompts, secrets, large file contents, and unredacted tool output should be classified and are redacted by default before publication.

## Follow-up issues
